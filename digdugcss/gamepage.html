        <h2>Description: </h2>
        <h3>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth.</h3>
        <h3>Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around.</h3>
        <h3>The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. </h3>
        <h3>(if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, </h3>
        <h3>rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for </h3>
        <h3>several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible </h3>
        <h3>and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</h3>
